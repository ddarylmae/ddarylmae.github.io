title: TDD-ing stuff
---

I can write tests (I think, or I think I can). But I didn't really get the chance to learn TDD and apply it in any of the projects I've worked with so far.

### What on earth is TDD?
TDD is defined as a style of development where code to test the functionality is written first before implementing the function itself. - From someone

### Tests determine what code you need to write
By writing tests first, I've learned how easier it is to take note of the different functionalities I need to implement and what rules or scenarios I need to consider beforehand. For example, when I was writing the tests for the user input

### Challenges
Here are some of the challenges I faced in learning TDD

#### Getting the rhythm of Red-Green-Refactor
Following the red-green-refactor steps and getting used to it was a bit difficult for me. It can be tempting at times to write the implementation right away. 

#### Second Challenge
Some stuff about second challenge
